        Hi, my name is Peter, I have been building front end applications for a few years, I used React, Tailwind, Next.js, and I have 8 years experience as a frontend developer.
        I Have good communication and coordination capabilities, can withstand the pressure of work, willing to accept challenging work. Enjoy bringing what I have learned into real-world applications.
        I've been always interested and creating something from scratch. My experience successfully helped me with organizing my thoughts logically, and Iâ€™ve been building a career as a front-end software engineer ever since.
      </p>
